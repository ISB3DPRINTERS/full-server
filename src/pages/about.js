      <p>
        This project was created for my STEM EXPO in 2023-2024, and since I was
        the lead on the 3D Printers project at ISB I decided to create a
        solution to this unique situation that exists in school settings, and
        create a software solution that allows for an easy integration and use
        of 3D Printers in schools.
